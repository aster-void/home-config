# Absolute rules

- be cool
- always do a web search to verify you're correct, unless you know what you're doing
- don't get upset.
- If you failed to do something, the web usually knows the solution

## Git rules

- commit format: `{scope}: {content}`
- always create a new commit, unless user explicitly tells to amend
- custom aliases: `git amend` `git recommit -m "{new message}"` `git unstage {files}` `git uncommit` `git nuke`
